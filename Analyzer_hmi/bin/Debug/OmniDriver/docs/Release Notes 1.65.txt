Release Notes for OmniDriver 1.65  - 2011.05.04


New Features
------------
1. Added native support for Linux x86_64 (i.e. 64-bit platform)
   We bundle Java JVM version 1.6.0_01 with this release.
   IMPORTANT: you MUST use this version of Java when running your OmniDriver applications.
   Otherwise you will get a segmentation fault when you run your app.


Bug Fixes
---------
1. A no-argument constructor has been added to the CIEColor object
   for the "C"/stdcall calling convention API.
2. Made communications with the JAZ unit more robust. Occasional network communication
   interruptions could result in OmniDriver mis-interpreting data sent by the JAZ,
   which in turn could result in bogus calibration settings being applied by OmniDriver
   to JAZ spectra.
3. HR4000 electric dark correction was using incorrect pixels.


Samples
-------
1. A new sample application has been added to the SamplePack.
   It demonstrates how to use the "C"/stdcall interface
   to OmniDriver in order to perform various color
   calculations using the SPAM library.
   It is located at C:\Ocean Optics\OmniDriverSamplePack\spam\win32\cpp\vs2005_cpp_c_AdvancedColor.
