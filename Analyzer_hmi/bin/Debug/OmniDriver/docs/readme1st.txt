OmniDriver 
----------

OmniDriver is divided into three distinct products:
1. OmniDriver only
2. OmniDriver+SPAM
3. SPAM only

Each of the above three products is supported on three operating system platforms:
1. Windows
2. Linux
3. Mac

When you purchase one of the above OmniDriver products, you receive access
to all three operating system platforms.

All downloadable installers are password protected.  
Each of the three products (OmniDriver, OmniDriverSPAM, SPAM) requires a different password.
All files for a given product share the same password.  Thus, for example, 
Windows installer for the SPAM product uses the same password as the Linux installer
for the SPAM product, and so forth.

Passwords for installing OmniDriver products can be obtained from your Ocean Optics
sales or support representatives.


For instructions on how to install your OmniDriver product, 
view the OmniDriver_Programming_Guide.pdf  This file is password protected,
using the same password as for the corresponding product installer. 
This PDF file is available as a separate download.

To see what has changed in the new release of OmniDriver,
