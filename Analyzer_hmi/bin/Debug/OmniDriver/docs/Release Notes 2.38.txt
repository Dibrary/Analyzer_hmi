Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.38  - 2015.05.05


New Features
------------
1. New methods were added, 'readRawUSB' and 'writeRawUSB', which allow direct access to the USB port. 
   They essentially bypass OOI controlled protocols and their respective checks so caution should be used 
   when exercising these methods. See OmniDriver Java documentation for further information.

2. Additional support was added for Flame-S and Flame-T spectrometers. The method 'getFirmwareModel' was 
   added to verify spectrometer types. The external indicator LEDs on these spectrometers can be controlled 
   via 'writeRawUSB'. The packet would consist of hex 13 followed by a 1 or 0 for 'on' or 'off' respectively.
   
3. New support was added for our spectral sensor called Spark. Spark has the capability of automatic USB
   driver discovery under most Windows operating systems. Spark was derived from the STS based family. 
      
4. New samples were added to 2.38 Sample pack:
	- OmniDriver demo in Excel
	- Simple GUI interface in C#
	- LabView 8.5 samples
	- Matlab samples
	- Linux Cpp example
	  
Bug Fixes
---------
1. For those users denied on-line access, window USB drivers are now provided for the QEPro and Spark devices. 
   These can be found under installed 'Offline' directories for both WinXP and Window 7,8,10.
