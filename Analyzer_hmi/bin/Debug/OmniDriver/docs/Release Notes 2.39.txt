Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.39  - 2015.07.10


New Features
------------
1. For Windows 32-bit install only: A selection will appear during product installation
   which gives a choice to install either WinUSB or EzUSB drivers. This avoids the confusion 
   of renaming driver dll files in order to switch between the two.

      
Bug Fixes
---------
1. For Spark product only: The first spectrum acquisition throws an exception an returns all zeros
   for intensity values. All subsequent request work normally. This has been corrected.
