Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.20  - 2012.09.12



New Features
------------
1. A new C# sample is provided named "SpeedTest".
   Customers can use this utility to determine the maximum performance possible for their
   spectrometer model on the Windows platform.  Performance is reported in "spectra per second".

2. The method of interpolation has been changed within the AdvancedColor.computeReflectiveChromaticity(),
   AdvancedColor.computeEmissiveChromaticity() and AdvancedPhotometrics.computeLuminousFluxLumens().
   In the past, interpolation was performed on the sample spectrum to obtain data points at the 5nm intervals 
   provided by the response spectrum (x-bar,y-bar,z-bar). If there were sharp peaks in the sample spectrum, 
   this method of interpolation could give poor results. The solution was to "reverse" the direction of interpolation.  
   Now we interpolate the response spectrum to obtain data points that correspond to each pixel of the sample spectrum.
   Since the response spectrum is fairly smooth, this produces "good" data.
   Also, we now use lagrange interpolation instead of linear or cubic spline interpolation.

3. Branding of the redistributable installers.
   Two new command line parameters have been added to the redistributable installers.
   One new parameter allows you to override the company name of "Ocean Optics", replacing it with your
   own company name.  The other new parameter allows you to override the product name of "OmniDriver", 
   replacing it with your own product name.
   The effect of these two new parameters is to specify the company name and product name as displayed
   on the various installer-wizard panels during the installation process.
   Additionally, when you specify both parameter overrides, OmniDriver will be installed into 
   C:\Program Files\your_company_name\your_product_name
   
   Example:
   	OmniDriver-2.20-win64-redistributable-installer.exe --company_name "AcmeCompany"  --product_name "RoadRunnerEliminatorKit"
   	
   IMPORTANT: Please avoid spaces in the company and product names you specify.
   	
   Further note: you are free to rename the installer EXE's to reflect your company and product name.
   
4. Additional signed drivers.
   Drivers for the following devices have now been certified by WHQL.
   This means they will install automatically when connected to your PC.
   - HR2000+
   - MayaPro2000
   - NIRQuest256/512
   

Bug Fixes
---------
1. A memory leak has been fixed.  The leak occurred whenever an I/O error or timeout occurred 
   when attempting to acquire spectra from the spectrometer by calling wrapper.getSpectrum().
   The memory leak condition does not occur during normal successful calls to getSpectrum().

2. Created a new ThermoElectricWrapper object which adds the methods getTECEnable() and getFanEnable().
   Wrapper.getFeatureControllerThermoElectric() has been modified to return
   the new ThermoElectricWrapper object instead of the older ThermoElectric object.
