Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.11  - June 6, 2012


New Features
------------

1. The installer for the Mac OS X platform has been rewritten.  
   OmniDriver for the Mac is now distributed as an application-bundle in the form of a *.tar.gz file.
   The new installer will create all necessary environment variables, and update the PATH automatically.
   Refer to the section titled "Installing on a Mac OS X Platform" in chapter two of the
   "OmniDriver Programming Manual" for more details.

2. All 32-bit OmniDriver installers may now be run on either 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.
   This allows customers to create a single 32-bit application that will run on
   both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.

3. The javadocs for OmniDriver have been pared down.  
   We have removed superfluous documentation for classes that are not a part of the public API.

Bug Fixes
---------
1. Due to a bug in our 64-bit Windows installers, users were required to manually install the drivers
   for their spectrometers on 64-bit Windows systems.  This has now been fixed. 
   As a result, the following spectrometers will automatically install the required driver
   when they are plugged in:
   USB2000, USB4000, HR4000, USB325, USB650, Amadeus/USB250/USB500, JAZ, STS
