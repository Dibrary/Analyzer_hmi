IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM VERSION 1.5 TO 1.6x FOR THE FIRST TIME
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading your OmniDriver installation from version 1.5 (or earlier) to version 1.6x
please read the following instructions carefully.


IMPORTANT - Before you upgrade to OmniDriver 1.6
---------
You will need to make minor changes to your OmniDriver
application in order to adapt it to use OmniDriver 1.6
Please carefully read the document titled
	"How to Upgrade Your Application to Use OmniDriver 1.6.pdf"
before installing OmniDriver 1.6
This document is organized into sections for each development
language. Find the section for the language you are developing with.


.NET Framework
--------------

MANDATORY!

Before you can install the new version of OmniDriver on Windows platforms,
you must first ensure that .NET Framework 2.0 or later has been installed.
Most Windows platforms will already satisfy this requirement.
But if you are using an older version of Windows, it may be necessary
for you to manually upgrade your system to .NET Framework 2.0.
Installers for 32-bit and 64-bit flavors of the .NET 2.0 Framework
may be downloaded directly from the Ocean Optics FTP server
at ftp://downloads.oceanoptics.net/OmniDriver/windows_dotnet_framework_installers/ 

The names of the installer files are:
32-bit: DotNetFramework_2.0_32bit.exe
64-bit: DotNetFramework_2.0_64bit.exe


Samples
-------
Samples have been moved into a separate installer for all Windows-based samples.
The name of the new installer is
OmniDriver_and_SPAM-OceanOpticsSamplePack-1.6-windows-installer.exe


NEW DRIVERS
-----------

On 64-bit Windows systems, OmniDriver 1.6 is distributed with a completely new 
low-level "driver" named "WinUSB".
32-bit Windows systems will continue to use the ezusb.sys driver for all Ocean Optics spectrometers.


64-bit Support
--------------
We now support 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.



.NET Support (COM is deprecated)
--------------------------------
This release of OmniDriver adds support for the .NET interface.
The principle benefit of the new OmniDriver .NET interface
is true multi-threading.  Threads will no longer be blocked
by OmniDriver function calls in other threads.
The COM interface has been deprecated, although it is still
available for applications which are developed in Visual Basic 6 (VB6).
