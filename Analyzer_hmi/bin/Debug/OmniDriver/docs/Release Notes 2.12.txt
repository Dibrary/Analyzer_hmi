Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.12  - June 20, 2012


New Features
------------

1. The installer for the Mac OS X platform has been rewritten.  
   OmniDriver for the Mac is now distributed as an application-bundle in the form of a *.tar.gz file.
   The new installer will create all necessary environment variables, and update the PATH automatically.
   Refer to the section titled "Installing on a Mac OS X Platform" in chapter two of the
   "OmniDriver Programming Manual" for more details.

2. The javadocs for OmniDriver have been pared down.  
   We have removed superfluous documentation for classes that are not a part of the public API.

3. ThermoElectric has been replaced by ThermoElectricWrapper.
   This new interface adds the getTECEnable() and getFanEnable() methods which were missing from ThermoElectric.

   

Bug Fixes
---------

1. Due to a bug in our 64-bit Windows installers, users must manually install the drivers
   for their spectrometers on 64-bit Windows systems.  This has now been fixed. 
   As a result, the following spectrometers will automatically install the required driver
   when they are plugged in:
   (USB2000, USB4000, HR4000, USB325, USB650, Amadeus/USB250/USB500, JAZ, STS)
   (TRACKER 2525)

2. When installing the 32-bit OmniDriver API on a 64-bit Windows platform,
   the installer will automatically replace the 32-bit NatUSB.dll with the 64-bit version.
   Thus, customers may run any 32-bit OmniDriver installer on any 32 or 64 bit Windows system
   and their 32-bit application will run on both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows platforms.

3. A bug has been fixed which prevented running more than one NIRQuest512 (or NIRQuest256) at a time.
