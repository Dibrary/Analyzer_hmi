The following manual installation procedure should NOT be necessary if you used
one of the automated installation wizards.

If at all possible, please use one of the following installation wizards, 
depending on your product and platform:

	- OmniDriverSPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Linux.bin
	- OmniDriverSPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Mac.dmg
	- OmniDriverSPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Win32.exe

	- OmniDriver_YYYY.MM.DD_Linux.bin
	- OmniDriver_YYYY.MM.DD_Mac.dmg
	- OmniDriver_YYYY.MM.DD_Win32.exe

	- SPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Linux.bin
	- SPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Mac.dmg
	- SPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_Win32.exe

If you are unable to use an installation wizard, then download the ZIP file which
corresponds to your product.  Choose one of the following:
	- OmniDriverSPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_LegacyWin32.zip file
	- OmniDriver_YYYY.MM.DD_LegacyWin32.zip file
	- SPAM_YYYY.MM.DD_LegacyWin32.zip file

Then perform the following steps.

1. Unzip the file to a NEW location. This will create a new directory tree
   whose root name corresponds to the ZIP file name.  There will be several new
   subdirectories, depending on which product you are installing.

2. Update your OOI_HOME environment variable to point to the newly created OOI_HOME directory.
   To do this on Windows:  go to the Control Panel, click on the "System" icon, click on the
   "Advanced" tab, then click on the "Environment Variables" button.  Then, in the "System Variables"
   list, find (or create) the OOI_HOME variable and set its value appropriately.

3. Make sure the new OOI_HOME directory is in the system PATH.
   To do this on Windows:  go to the Control Panel, click on the "System" icon, click on the
   "Advanced" tab, then click on the "Environment Variables" button.  Then, in the "System Variables"
   list, find (or create) the PATH variable and set its value appropriately.

4. Register the new DLL(s) (Windows only)
   A. Open a DOS window
   B. cd into the new OOI_HOME directory
   C. If the file "OmniDriver32.dll" is present, type the command
      regsvr32 OmniDriver32.dll
   D. If the file SPAM32.dll is present, type the command
	  regsvr32 SPAM32.dll
   E. If the registration process(es) were successful, you should see a small popup window
	  after about 10-15 seconds indicating the DLL was registered.

5. For Windows users:
   If you are installing the "OmniDriver" or "OmniDriverSPAM" products,
   perform the following copy commands.
   copy *.sys from the drivers directory to c:\windows\system32\drivers
   copy *.inf from the drivers directory to c:\Windows\inf

6. For Linux users: 
   If you are installing the "OmniDriver" or "OmniDriverSPAM" products,
   perform the following steps.
   - Copy the file 10-oceanoptics.rules from the "drivers" directory into /etc/udev/rules.d
   - restart udev.  On Fedora and similar linux distros, you can restart
     udev with the following commands:
     udevcontrol reload_rules
     udevstart
     If this does not successfully restart udev, you will need to reboot.
   - Make certain the "libusb" library has been installed on your system.  It should be a relatively recent
     version of the library.  You can use the "apt" utility to check if it has been installed.

7. For all products and platforms: 
   If you have not already downloaded and installed the Java JRE 1.6 or above, please do so now.
   This is necessary to use OmniDriver, regardless of which language you are developing in.
   IMPORTANT: If you are developing in the "C" or C++ language, you must install the "JDK" form of java.
   It may help to avoid confusion if you uninstall any previous versions of java on your system,
   but this is optional.
   Add the new version of java to your system PATH.  The location of java should be something
   like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_05\bin"
   To verify that the system is using the new version of java, open a DOS window and type
   "java -version".  It should indicate you are running java 1.6 or later.
