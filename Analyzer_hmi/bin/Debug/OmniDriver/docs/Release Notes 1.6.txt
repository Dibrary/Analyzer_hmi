Release Notes for OmniDriver 1.6


IMPORTANT - Before you upgrade to OmniDriver 1.6
---------
You will need to make minor changes to your OmniDriver
application in order to adapt it to use OmniDriver 1.6
Please carefully read the document titled
"How to Upgrade Your Application to Use OmniDriver 1.6.pdf"
before installing OmniDriver 1.6
This document is organized into sections for each development
language. Find the section for the language you are developing with.


.NET Framework
--------------

MANDATORY!

Before you can install the new version of OmniDriver on Windows platforms,
you must first ensure that .NET Framework 2.0 or later has been installed.
Most Windows platforms will already satisfy this requirement.
But if you are using an older version of Windows, it may be necessary
for you to manually upgrade your system to .NET Framework 2.0.
Installers for 32-bit and 64-bit flavors of the .NET 2.0 Framework
may be downloaded directly from the Ocean Optics FTP server
at ftp://downloads.oceanoptics.net/OmniDriver/Windows

The names of the installer files are:
32-bit: DotNetFramework_2.0_32bit.exe
64-bit: DotNetFramework_2.0_64bit.exe


Samples
-------
Samples have been moved into a separate installer for all Windows-based samples.
The name of the new installer is
OmniDriver_and_SPAM-OceanOpticsSamplePack-1.6-windows-installer.exe


NEW DRIVERS
-----------

On 64-bit Windows systems, OmniDriver 1.6 is distributed with a completely new 
low-level "driver" named "WinUSB".
32-bit Windows systems will continue to use the ezusb.sys driver for all Ocean Optics spectrometers.


64-bit Support
--------------
The primary purpose of this release is to add support for 64-bit Windows operating systems.
We now support 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.



.NET Support (COM is deprecated)
--------------------------------
This release of OmniDriver adds support for the .NET interface.
The principle benefit of the new OmniDriver .NET interface
is true multi-threading.  Threads will no longer be blocked
by OmniDriver function calls in other threads.
The COM interface has been deprecated, although it is still
available for applications which are developed in Visual Basic 6 (VB6).



VB6 Limitation
--------------
VB6 applications ARE supported on 64-bit operating systems.
But they must run in 32-bit mode.



Other New Features
------------------
1. Added support for the Remora wireless device.
   To open a spectrometer attached to the Remora, make the following call:
   wrapper->getWrapperExtensions()->openRemoteSpectrometer(String ipAddress, String deviceType, String busType)
   where:
   	ipAddress is something like "192.168.42.7"
   	deviceType is either "remora" or "Jaz-(Network)"
   	busType must be set to "internet"
   This new function returns a spectrometerIndex number which may be used when calling other
   Wrapper API functions to identify which spectrometer is to be used.

2. VB6 (Visual Basic 6) developers may now use the COM interface to the omniDriver and SPAM libraries.
   When assigning object references to VB variables, remember to use the "Set" keyword in your assignment statement.
   For example:
   Set versionFeatureController = wrapper.getFeatureControllerVersion(0) ' example of correct syntax
   The "Set" keyword is NOT necessary when assigning all other non-object datatypes to VB variables.
   CAVEAT: when testing the return value from functions which return a boolean value, do not compare the
   return value with the symbolic true/false values.  Instead, use 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false.
   NOTE: the more awkward "C" interface to OmniDriver may still be used, although we do not
   provide DLL function declarations in OmniDriver.bas for the SPAM objects and methods.

3. Minor addition to the VBA sample named "AcquireSpectrum.xls"

4. Added support for the ARCoptix spectrometer.  Mention that the user must install the SpectraSuiteHub.

5. Added support for the Dragon spectrometer (tracker 1343).

6. Implemented per-spectrometer saturation threshold setting for the MayaPRO spectrometer (tracker 1369)

7. Changed WrapperExtensions.getBadPixels() to return short[] instead of int[] -- to see if this fixes the problem
   with the COM interface to this method.

8. On 64-bit Windows systems, we have replaced the old EZUSB.SYS USB driver with the new WinUSB driver.
   The WinUSB-based drivers have been "signed" to assure integrity and simplify installation.

9. Added an option to override the default Java JVM memory size.  The default size has been reduced from 250MB to 80MB.
   This should eliminate the "Can't load JVM" errors that sometimes occur when using OmniDriver with LabVIEW.
   On Linux, Mac, and 64-bit Windows platforms, the default JVM memory size is 250MB.
   On 32-bit Windows platforms, the default is 80MB.
   If your application requires more memory (possibly due to large buffers needed by the high-speed-acquisition feature),
   create a file in the OOI_HOME directory named jvm_option.memorysize
   Insert a single line in this file like the following (but with no leading spaces):
   	-Xmx128m
   This example will set the JVM memory size to 128 megabytes.
   To revert to the default setting for JVM memory size, simply delete the jvm_option.memorysize file.
   This line is case-sensitive, so be careful.  
   If you make a mistake and specify invalid syntax, you will get the error message "Cannot create JVM.  return code = -6"
   when your application starts up.

10. All sample projects have been moved to a separate installer.

11. Corrected a version number check in the AnalogOut feature for the ADC1000-USB.  Should require firmware version 1.01.0
    to support this feature.  (tracker 1564)



Bug Fixes
---------
1. Fix problem with USB500 wavelength calibration (tracker 1377).

2. IOExceptions when performing I2CBus read operations will no longer cause application to crash.
   Instead, it will return a zero-length byte array.  The user can call wrapper.getLastException()
   to determine the nature of the error.  [tracker 1380]

3. Fix bug in several GPIO methods: setValueAllBits(), setDirectionAllBits() and setMuxAllBits()
   BitSet.bitSetToShort() method should use length() instead of size() in three places. [tracker 592]

4. Fix declaration of Wrapper_getWrapperExtensions() in OmniDriver.bas.  This caused VB6 applications
   to crash if they called this method.  The vb6_c_SpectrometerAcquisition sample application has been 
   modified accordingly. (tracker 1435)

5. Corrected a bug in the Mac OmniDriver sample "GPPSpectrumTest_Mac" and added a script to build the sample
   from the command line.

6. Fixed problems that prevented the SPI communication feature from working on spectrometers that support this protocol.
