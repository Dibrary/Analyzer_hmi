Release Notes for OmniDriver 2.10  - 2012.02.29


New Features
------------

1. Added support for STS pixel-binning modes.
   The new C# demo application "STSFeatures" illustrates how to use this feature.

2. Two new methods have been added to the Wrapper API that give the STS spectrometer
   the unique ability to recover from an unresponsive state when the spectrometer has been
   placed in one of the hardware trigger modes and no trigger signal occurs.
   Formerly it was necessary to physically unplug the spectrometer and reconnect it
   in order to recover from this state.
   Refer to the javadocs for the wrapper method named sendSimulatedTriggerSignal() for details
   on how to use this new capability.
   This new capability is also demonstrated in a new C# sample named "STSFeatures".

3. Create a new getFeatureController_USB_LS450_ExternalTemperature() method 
   that exposes the "ExternalTemperatureWrapper" interface.  
   The external temperature probe "piggy-backs" off the USB_LS450 device.


4. USB4000 now supports "uniform trigger modes".

   

Bug Fixes
---------

1. The "InternalTrigger" feature has been fixed - the missing method getInternalTriggerPeriodMicros() 
   has been implemented in the public interface.
   wrapper.getFeatureControllerInternalTrigger() has been modified to return a new object named
   "InternalTriggerWrapper".  InternalTriggerWrapper contains the missing method.

2. High-speed acquisition unnecessary overhead removed for the STS spectrometer.
